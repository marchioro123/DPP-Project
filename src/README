--- Project
The projects attempts efficient parallel implementations of v-graph,
parent vector, and v-tree conversions (as described by Blellochs PHD and
the KU DPP lectures). Created in Futhark by Martin Bom Marchioro and
Rasmus Ross Nylandsted.


--- Layout
- parents_conv.fut:    Contains parents to v-tree conversion functions.
- directed_conv.fut:   Contains directed v-graph to parents conversion functions.
- undirected_conv.fut: Contains undirected v-graph to parents conversion functions.
- helpers.fut:         Contains parallel utility and data-generation functions.
- plot.py:             A script for plotting benchmark .json data.


--- Dependencies
- A machine capable of C, Cuda, and OpenCL execution.

- The Futhark compiler (for main execution)
  * lib/github.com/diku-dk/sorts/radix_sort library
  * lib/github.com/diku-dk/cpprandom/random library 

- A Python3 interpreter (for benchmark plotting)
  * sys library
  * numpy library
  * matplotlib library
  * json library


--- Execution
- Testing:      $ make test
- Benchmarking: $ make benchmark
- Plotting:     $ make plot
- Cleaning:     $ make clean
